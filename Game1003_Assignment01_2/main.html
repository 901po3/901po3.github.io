					Every facility has unique features and designs. Since these bunkers are made to sustain many refugees over extremely long period of time,
					the level of the facility is generally good. So far, this corportaion seems very charming...right?</em></p>
					<br/>
					<h3><em>Internal activity</em></h3>
					<p><em>Now, let's talk about another purpose. However, I want to mention that internal purpose of Vault-Tec is very interesting that 
					hooks many gamers including me, and maybe even you. The main purpose of the Company is human experiment. Every single shelter has been set up to do 
					different experiment, and some of them are really interesting. Let me give you some example, 
					one shelter purposely put only one male with many females, and opposite case too. 
					There is a shelter that purposely cut the supply to watch reaction. 
					There's even a shelter which didn't even closed the gate properly to watch people getting infested with radiation exposure slowly.
					Considering the number of shelters are more than 100, they experiment almost everything that you can come up with in your mind.</em></p>
